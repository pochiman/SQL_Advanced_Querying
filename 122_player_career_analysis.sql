-- PART III: PLAYER CAREER ANALYSIS

-- TASK 1: View the players table and find the number of players in the table
SELECT * FROM players;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;

-- TASK 2: For each player, calculate their age at their first (debut) game, their last game,
-- and their career length (all in years). Sort from longest career to shortest career. [Datetime Functions]
SELECT 	nameGiven,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), debut)
			AS starting_age,
		TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), finalGame)
			AS ending_age,
		TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, debut, finalGame) AS career_length
FROM	players
ORDER BY career_length DESC;

/* Datetime functions vary widely by RDBMS:

- MySQL:		TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), debut)
- Oracle:		MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE(birthYear || '-' || birthMonth || '-' || birthDay, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), debut) / 12
- PostgreSQL:	DATE_PART('year', debut) - DATE_PART('year', TO_DATE(birthYear || '-' || birthMonth || '-' || birthDay, 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
- SQL Server:	DATEDIFF(YEAR, CAST(birthYear + '-' + birthMonth + '-' + birthDay AS DATE), debut)
- SQLite:		CAST((STRFTIME('%Y', debut) - STRFTIME('%Y', birthYear || '-' || birthMonth || '-' || birthDay)) AS INTEGER)
