-- 11. Subquery vs CTE vs Temp Table vs View

-- Subquery
SELECT * FROM

(SELECT	year, country, happiness_score FROM happiness_scores
UNION ALL
SELECT	2024, country, ladder_score FROM happiness_scores_current) AS my_subquery;

-- CTE
WITH my_cte AS (SELECT	year, country, happiness_score FROM happiness_scores
				UNION ALL
				SELECT	2024, country, ladder_score FROM happiness_scores_current)
                
SELECT * FROM my_cte;

-- Temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE my_temp_table AS
SELECT	year, country, happiness_score FROM happiness_scores
UNION ALL
SELECT	2024, country, ladder_score FROM happiness_scores_current;

SELECT * FROM my_temp_table;

-- View
CREATE VIEW my_view AS
SELECT	year, country, happiness_score FROM happiness_scores
UNION ALL
SELECT	2024, country, ladder_score FROM happiness_scores_current;

SELECT * FROM my_view;
